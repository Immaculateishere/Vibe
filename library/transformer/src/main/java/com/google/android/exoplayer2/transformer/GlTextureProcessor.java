/**
 * Processes frames from one OpenGL 2D texture to another.

 * #maybeQueueInputFrame(TextureInfo, long)} and surrenders each texture back to the caller via its
 * {@linkplain Listener#onInputFrameProcessed(TextureInfo) listener} once the texture's contents
 * have been processed.
 *
 * <p>The {@code GlTextureProcessor} produces output frames asynchronously and notifies its owner
 * when they are available via its {@linkplain Listener#onOutputFrameAvailable(TextureInfo, long)
 * listener}. The {@code GlTextureProcessor} instance's owner must surrender the texture back to the
 * {@code GlTextureProcessor} via {@link #releaseOutputFrame(TextureInfo)} when it has finished
 * processing it.
 *
 * <p>{@code GlTextureProcessor} implementations can choose to produce output frames before
 * receiving input frames or process several input frames before producing an output frame. However,
 * {@code GlTextureProcessor} implementations cannot assume that they will receive more than one
 * input frame at a time, so they must process each input frame they accept even if they cannot
 * produce output yet.
 *
 * <p>The methods in this interface must be called on the thread that owns the parent OpenGL
 * context. If the implementation uses another OpenGL context, e.g., on another thread, it must
 * configure it to share data with the context of thread the interface methods are called on.
