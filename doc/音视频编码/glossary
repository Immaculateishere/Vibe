1.AOMedia Video 1（简称AV1）是一个开放、免专利的视频编码格式，专为通过网络进行流传输而设计.
AV1可以与Opus音频格式一起封装在WebM容器格式中，并可用于HTML5网络视频和网页即时通信

2.BandwidthMeter
Component that estimates the network bandwidth

3.DataSource
Component for requesting data (e.g. over HTTP, from a local file, etc).

4.Extractor
Component that parses a media container format, outputting track information and
individual access units belonging to each track suitable for consumption by a decoder.

5.LoadControl
Component that decides when to start and stop loading, and when to start playback.

6.MediaSource
Provides high-level information about the structure of media (as a Timeline) and
creates MediaPeriod instances (corresponding to periods of the Timeline) for playback.

7.MediaPeriod
Loads a single piece of media (e.g. audio file, ad, content interleaved between two ads, etc.),
and allows the loaded media to be read (typically by Renderers).
The decisions about which tracks within the media are loaded and when loading starts and
stops are made by the TrackSelector and the LoadControl respectively.

8.Renderer
Component that reads, decodes and renders media samples.
Surface and AudioTrack are the standard Android platform components to which video and audio data are rendered.

9.Timeline
Represents the structure of media, from simple cases like a single media file through
to complex compositions of media such as playlists and streams with inserted ads.

10.TrackGroup
Group containing one or more representations of the same video, audio or text content,
normally at different bitrates for adaptive streaming.

11.TrackSelection
A selection consisting of a static subset of tracks from a TrackGroup,
and a possibly varying selected track from the subset.
For adaptive streaming, the TrackSelection is responsible for selecting the appropriate track
whenever a new media chunk starts being loaded.

12.TrackSelector
Selects tracks for playback. Given track information for the MediaPeriod to be played,
along with the capabilities of the player’s Renderers,
a TrackSelector will generate a TrackSelection for each Renderer.
