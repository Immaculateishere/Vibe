1.Media sources
  DashMediaSource for DASH
  SsMediaSource for SmoothStreaming
  HlsMediaSource for HLS
  ProgressiveMediaSource for regular media files


2.UI Component
  SurfaceView should therefore be preferred over TextureView where possible.
  where smooth animations or scrolling of the video surface is required prior to Android N
  it is preferable to use TextureView only when SDK_IN is less than 24

  SurfaceView rendering was not properly synchronized with view animations until Android N. (it is necessary to use TextureView rather than SurfaceView)
